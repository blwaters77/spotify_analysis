# Spotify Popularity Analysis 🎧

This project analyzes a dataset of Spotify tracks to explore what features contribute to a song’s popularity. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), examined correlations between variables, and visualized key trends across genres and artists.

## 📁 Files
- `Stats 21 Final Project.ipynb` — Main analysis notebook
- `Spotify_track.csv` — Dataset used
- `Stats 21 Final Project.pdf` — PDF version of the notebook

## 📊 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Questions
- What audio features (danceability, energy, etc.) are most strongly associated with track popularity?
- Do certain artists consistently produce more popular music?
- Are there genre-level trends in track popularity?

## 📌 How to Run
Open the notebook in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook and run the cells sequentially. You’ll need the dataset file (`Spotify_track.csv`) in the same directory.
